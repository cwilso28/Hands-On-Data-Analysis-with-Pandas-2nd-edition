    "- This chapter will focus on developing a workflow to pull and analyze financial data\n",
    "- The material in this chapter will rely on the object oriented programming functionality of Python\n",
    "  - Classes, decorators, etc. will be developed to accomplish the goal of analyzing the data\n",
    "    - The main classes built include the following:\n",
    "      - `StockReader`\n",
    "      - `Visualizer` (multiple)\n",
    "      - `StockAnalyzer`\n",
    "      - `StockModeler`\n",
    "    - These classes will be housed in a Python package\n",
    "    - Each class will have a single purpose, this practice makes each class easier to build\n",
    "-Building a Python package\n",
    "  - Packages are good coding practice as they allow for modular code and reuse\n",
    "  - A module is a single file of python code that can be imported\n",
    "  - A package is a collection of modules organized into directories\n",
    "    - We've imported packages as a whole, but we've also imported specific modules from packages without importing the entire thing\n",
    "  - To turn a module into a package, the following is performed\n",
    "    1. Create a directory with the name of the package\n",
    "    2. Place the modules in the new directory\n",
    "    3. Add an `__init__.py` file containing any Python code to run upon package import\n",
    "    4. Make a `setup.py` file at the same level as the package's top-level directory\n",
    "       - This will give `pip` instructions on how to install the package\n",
    "  - A package can contain as many subpackages as you want\n",
    "    - Subpackages are setup the same as the main package, just without a `setup.py` file\n",
    "    - There is an example directory hierarchy for a package on Pg. 398\n",
    "  - It's also helpful to include the following: \n",
    "    - a README file for the package repository\n",
    "    - Lint the code so it conforms to standards and check for errors\n",
    "    - Add tests to make sure changes don't break the code\n",
    "- Stock Analysis Package\n",
    "  - The stock analysis package contains many classes, covering multiple facets of financial analysis\n",
    "  - Pg. 399 to 400 discuss UML diagrams and shows the diagram for the stock analysis package"

    "- Collecting financial data\n",
    "  - The StockReader class\n",
    "    - Web scraping is used to extract data from the HTML page itself\n",
    "    - Data for various assets across the same date range will be collected, so it makes sense to create a class to prevent repeat code\n",
    "      - These assets include bitcoin, stocks, and stock market indicies\n",
    "    - The UML diagram for this class can be found on pg. 401\n",
    "    - The code for this class can be found in `stock_reader.py`\n",
    "      - The first line of the module is the docstring for the module\n",
    "        - This is pulled up when `help()` is called on the module and helps describe the purpose of the module\n",
    "      - The imports follow next, following PEP 8 style guidelines\n",
    "        - Standard library imports are first, third-party libraries second, and relative imports from another module in the `stock_analysis` package\n",
    "      - The actual definition of the `StockReader` class is defined next\n",
    "        - The class also has a docstring\n",
    "      - The first item defined in the class is a dictionary, `_index_ticker`, mapping tickers for indicies\n",
    "        - This attribute starts with an underscore to make it private, so it won't be listed when attributes and methods of the class are displayed\n",
    "        - `_index_ticker` isn't defined in the `__init__()` method as we don't want that to be initialized for every object created, but shared between all objects\n",
    "        - To see what is available in `_index_ticker` without giving users the ability to modify it, a property for the keys in `_index_ticker` will be created\n",
    "          - This takes te form of a decorator: A function that wraps around other functions, allow for the execution of extra code before and/or after the inner function executes\n",
    "      - The next item is an `__init__()` method which initializes an object when using the class\n",
    "        - This `__init__()` method holds on to the start and end dates of the data we're interested in\n",
    "          - The dates are parsed so that any date separator can be used\n",
    "          - A `ValueError` is raised in the start date is equal to or after the end date\n",
    "      - Decorators are used frequently in this class\n",
    "        - Decorators begin with '@' signs and are placed above a the function or method definition\n",
    "        - The `@label_sanitizer` decorator is designed to reformat column names to all the same format, removing all non character or non whitespace characters\n",
    "          - A private function is setup first that simply cleans an input string and then utilized by the defined decorator to clean column names specifically\n",
    "          - In addition, an `@wraps` decoration from the `functools` module in the standard library is used to give the decorated function/method with the same docstring it had beforehand\n",
    "      - A class method was used in this module to get the tickers, as they are stored as class variables\n",
    "        - The class method receives `cls` as the first argument while instance methods, the typical method, receive `self`\n",
    "        - A try, except block is used to provide additional information to raised errors\n",
    "      - The foundation method is `get_ticker_data()`\n",
    "        - The pulls finance data from Yahoo! Finance\n",
    "        - The method relies on the `pandas_datareader` package, but updates in the Yahoo! Finance API can cause issues. Check the documentation when using.\n",
    "        - Note that this method has the `@label_sanitizer` decorator on it\n",
    "      - The next important method is `get_index_data()`\n",
    "        - This looks up an index's ticker and calls the `get_ticker_data()` method on it\n",
    "        - The decorator applied to `get_ticker_data()` also applies to this method\n",
    "      - Bitcoin data is available through Yahoo! Finance and can be retrieved using the `get_bitcoin_data()` method\n",
    "        - A currency code must be input\n",
    "        - This method also relies on the `get_ticker_data()` method"

    "        - Since `_window_calc()` isn't defined here, each subclass will have it's own implementation, which will inhereit the top-level method without overriding `moving_average()` or `exp_smoothing()`\n",
    "      - The subclasses to `Visualizer` will inherit, overide, or define unique methods for their own implementation\n",
    "    - The first subclass of `Visualizer` is `StockVisualizer`, used to handle single assets only\n",
    "      - `StockVisualizer` doesn't override the `__init__()` method of the parent class\n",

    "          - Uses the `fill_between()` static method to visualize the daily difference between opening and closing price, coloring the area green if the closing price is higher than the opening and red vice versa\n",

    "          - Uses `fill_between()` again to vizualize the difference between the asset used to create the visualization and another asset, with the area colored green when the visualizer's asset is higher\n",
