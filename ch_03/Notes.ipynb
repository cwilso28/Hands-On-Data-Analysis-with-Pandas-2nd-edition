    "- Data wrangling is taking data and turning it into something meaningful for analysis, also known as data manipulation\n",
    "  - Being clear about the steps taken during data wrangling helps prevent deception of data\n",
    "- Data wrangling can be broken down into the following:\n",
    "  - Data Cleaning\n",
    "    - Follows data importing\n",
    "    - Includes renaming, sorting, filter, converting data types, and addressing duplicates and nulls\n",
    "  - Data Transformation\n",
    "    - Conversion between wide and long form of data\n",
    "    - Wide data is good for analysis and database design\n",
    "      - Data is represented with measurements of variables as unique columns and one observation per row\n",
    "    - Long data is good for plotting and for a fixed table schema\n",
    "  - Data Enrichment\n",
    "    - Adding to data to make it more meaningful\n",
    "    - This includes adding new columns, binning, aggregation, and resampling\n",
