    "- Advanced plotting with seaborn\n",
    "  - Seaborn provides additional functionality for more complex visualizations and makes creating visualizations with long-format data easier\n",
    "  - Categorical data\n",
    "    - In matplotlib, scatter plots are limited to two numeric variables\n",
    "    - Seaborn adds `stripplot()` and `swarmplot()` which lets you use one categorical and one numeric variable\n",
    "      - `stripplot()` can have overlaped points while `swarmplot()` has none\n",
    "      - `swarmplot()` gives a better idea of the point distribution\n",
    "    - Enhanced box plots with `boxenplot()` gives a better idea of data distribution, showing additional quantiles at the tails\n",
    "      - Box plots lose data about distributions\n",
    "    - Violin plots, with `violinplot()`, add kernel density estimates to the box plot\n",
    "  - Correlations and heatmaps\n",
    "    - `heatmap()` can be used to create heatmaps based on correlations between variables\n",
    "    - `pairplot()` is an alternative to heatmaps, showing scatter plots instead\n",
    "      - The scatter plots help show correlated variables at a quick glance\n",
    "      - Histograms are plotted on the diagonals\n",
    "      - KDEs can be plotted instead of histograms\n",
    "      - `jointplot()` lets you compare two variables, with histograms on the borders\n",
    "        - Using the `hex` input to the `kind` argument generates a hexplot, which is a two dimensional histogram\n",
    "        - The data can be viewed as contours with `kind = 'kde'`\n",
    "        - Regressions can also be added to the plots with `kind = 'reg'`\n",
    "  - Regression plots\n",
    "    - Regression lines can be created with `regplot()` and regressions with residuals can be created with `residplot()`\n",
    "    - Iterables are used in this example\n",
    "      - The `itertools` module can be imported to make iterating easier\n",
    "      - Iterables are objects that can be iterated over\n",
    "      - When starting a loop with an iterable, an iterator is created\n",
    "        - The iterator provides the next value until exhausted\n",
    "        - Iterators can be reused after the first use\n",
    "      - Lists are an iterable that can be reused\n",
    "      - This example also relies heavily on the `zip()` function\n",
    "    - `lmplot()` can be used to plot regressions across different subsets of data\n",
    "  - Faceting\n",
    "    - Allows plotting of subsets of data across subplots with `FacetGrid()`\n",
    "    - `FacetGrid()` sets the data to be used in the grids, `map()` can be used to specify the plot type\n",
    "- Formatting plots with matplotlib\n",
    "  - Titles and labels\n",
    "    - Titles can be added with matplotlib using `plt.title()`\n",
    "      - The title can be positioned with x and y values and format can be controlled\n",
    "      - This behaves different for subplots\n",
    "    - Axes can be labeled with `plt.xlabel()` and `plt.ylabel()`\n",
    "    - When working with subplots, `plt.title()` generates a title for the last plot to be generated\n",
    "      - `plt.suptitle()` will generate a title for the overall plot, above all of the subplots\n",
    "      - Individual axis labels can be generated using the `set_ylabel()` function on the specified Axes object\n",
    "  - Legends\n",
    "    - Legend aspects can be controlled through the `plt.legend()` function and `Axes.legend()` method\n",
    "      - Can control legend location and look, which includes fonts and colors\n",
    "    - Commonly used parameters include `loc`, `bbox_to_anchor`, `ncol`, `framealpha`, and `title`\n",
    "    - By default, `matplotlib` will find the best location for the legend\n",
    "      - The `loc` argument can be used to customize the legend location\n",
    "      - Location strings can be passed to `loc`\n",
    "    - `ncol` can help control the shape of the legend with many entries by adding columns\n",
    "  - Formatting axes\n",
    "    - Formatting axes in `matplotlib` can be done with either the `plt.xlim()`/`plt.ylim()` functions or the `set_xlim()`/`set_ylim()` methods on Axes objects\n",
    "      - Min and max values are passed to both of these\n",
    "    - The scale of the axes can be changed with `plt.xscale()`/`plt.yscale()`\n",
    "      - Ex. `plt.yscale('log')` changes the y scale from linear to log\n",
    "    - Tick mark visibility and location can be set by `plt.xticks()`/`plt.yticks()`\n",
    "    - Axis label format can be modified using the `PercentFormatter` class in the `matplotlib.ticker` module\n",
    "      - There are many other formatting options in this module, like `EngFormatter` for engineering notation\n",
    "      - The `MultipleLocator` class allows for placement of ticks at a multiple of a number of locations\n",
    "- Customizing visualizations\n",
    "  - Adding reference lines\n",
    "    - Sometimes specific values or areas need to be highlighted\n",
    "    - Horizontal reference lines can be added with `plt.axhline()`\n",
    "      - These are useful for y axis related boundaries\n",
    "    - Vertical reference lines can be drawn with the `plt.axvline()` method\n",
    "  - Shading regions\n",
    "    - Line the reference lines, vertical and horizontal shaded regions can be drawn by calling the `axvspan()` and `axhspan()` methods on `Axes` objects\n",
    "    - The area between curves can be shaded using the `plt.fill_between()` or `plt.fill_betweenx()` functions\n",
    "      - The `plt.fill_between()` function fills between two y values, `plt.fill_betweenx()` fills between two x values\n",
    "      - Boolean masks can be provided with the `where` argument so that only certain sections are filled\n",
    "  - Annotations\n",
    "    - Add labels to values can be done with the `plt.annotate()` function\n",
    "      - Annotations can be placed with `xy` and `xytext` arguments\n",
    "      - `xy` can be used to place arrows and pointers, `xytext` can be used to place text\n",
    "      - Arrows can be added using the `arrowprops` argument\n",
    "  - Colors\n",
    "    - Plot colors should be consistent, but color palettes can be easily adopted\n",
    "    - For example, the `color` argument can be used in the `df.plot()` method\n",
    "      - Colors can be specified by single character names, `matplotlib` colors, hex code strings, and rbg and alpha codes (in the range of [0,1])\n",
    "    - Colormaps can be provided, these can be cycled through automatically\n",
    "      - There are three different types of colormaps: qualitative, sequential, and diverging\n",
    "        - Qualitative colormaps have no ordering or relationship between colors\n",
    "        - Sequential colormaps are used for information with ordering\n",
    "        - Diverging colormaps has a middle value between two extremes\n",
    "      - Colormap names can be found with the `cm.datad.keys()` function from the `cm` module in the `matplotlib` package\n",
    "        - Colormap names in reverse order are colormaps in reverse order\n",
    "      - Colormap colors can be chosen by passing a value in the range [0,1] to the `colormap` object callable\n",
    "        - This can be passed onto the `color` argument\n",
    "      - Custom colormaps can be generated using the `color_util.py` package\n",
    "      - The example provided on pg. 378 to 380\n",
    "      - Conditional coloring can also be applied using colormaps\n",
    "        - The example on pg. 383 provides a method to create a generator to determine plot color based on the data\n",
    "          - The advantage of the generator is that it calculates the conditions and color only when it's asked to\n",
    "  - Textures\n",
    "    - Textures can be used to enhance plots beyond color, especially where color isn't useful, i.e. color blindness or where differences in colors are difficult to discern\n",
    "    - Textures can be applied in the `df.plot()` and `plt.fill_between()` methods using the `hatch` argument"
